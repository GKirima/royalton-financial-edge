## 🧱 Recommended AWS Services & Integration Flow

| Layer | AWS Service | Purpose & Integration |
|:------|:------------|:----------------------|
| **Presentation Tier** | Amazon S3 + CloudFront | Hosts static HTML/CSS/JS with global CDN, SSL via CloudFront |
|  | Amazon Route 53 | DNS and domain routing for `royalton-edge.com` |
| **Authentication** | Amazon Cognito | Manages user pools, MFA, login/signup, token-based access |
| **Document Uploads** | Amazon S3 (Secure Bucket) | Identity/tax doc storage, secured via IAM + Cognito identities |
| **Backend APIs** | Amazon API Gateway | REST APIs for form submissions, onboarding, chatbot, etc. |
|  | AWS Lambda | Serverless business logic for each API endpoint |
| **Data Management** | Amazon DynamoDB | NoSQL store for user profiles, onboarding, preferences, low-latency and highly scalable |
|  | Amazon Timestream | Time-series data for analytics & usage metrics |
| **Chatbot Layer** | Amazon Lex + Lambda | Natural language interface with custom Lambda replies |
| **Security & Networking** | IAM, VPC, AWS WAF | Role-based access, secure endpoints, firewall protection |
| **Monitoring & CI/CD** | CloudWatch + CodePipeline | Logs, metrics, automated builds & deployments |

## 🛠 End-to-End Service Integration Flow

```plaintext
User accesses → Route53 → CloudFront → S3 (Static Website)

│
├─▶ “Client Login” → Cognito Hosted UI → Token Issuance → Access Authorized APIs
├─▶ “New Client Onboarding” → Upload Docs → Secure S3 → Onboarding Logic (Lambda → DynamoDB)
├─▶ Form Submission → API Gateway → Lambda → Store in DB
├─▶ Chatbot Interaction → Frontend → API Gateway → Lambda → Lex → Respond
│
└─▶ Admin Login → Cognito → Admin Portal → Onboarding Status → API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB
```

## 🚀 Presentation Tier Recommendation: **Static**

**Static Tier Benefits:**
- 🚀 Instant global delivery with CloudFront
- 🛡️ Reduced attack surface
- 💰 Cost-effective hosting with S3
- 🔧 Easy integration with JS-powered APIs for dynamic features

Use static rendering with dynamic hydration via API calls—perfect for performance and scalability.

## 🧠 Comparison: Serverless Modular vs Microservices Architecture

| Feature | Serverless Modular | Microservices Architecture |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Deployment | Lambda (FaaS) | Containers (ECS/EKS) or EC2 |
| Scalability | Auto-scale per invocation | Requires container orchestration |
| Cost | Pay-per-request | Higher base cost, more infra |
| Latency | Cold start risk | Warm containers maintain performance |
| Inter-Service Communication | API Gateway to Lambda | REST/GraphQL between services |
| State | Shared (DynamoDB) | Service-owned databases |
| DevOps | Lightweight CI/CD (CodePipeline) | Complex orchestration & monitoring |
| Best Fit | Startups, MVPs, agile teams | Large organizations, domain-driven design |
